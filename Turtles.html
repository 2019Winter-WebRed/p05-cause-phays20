					 <p> Plastic affects turtles all around the world daily. More than 80% of this plastic comes from land. It washes out from our beaches and streets. It travels through storm drains into streams and rivers". Sea turtles face other obstacles such as predators... Racoons, crabs and birds who eat the eggs as snacks.  The turtles need to have a better protected habitat to lay their eggs, have a seure home for food and shelter. </p> 
			 <p> As a whole we should help protect animals and prevent more plastic from causing harm. Saving animals is the right thing to do and we need the help we can get!</p>

		 <p id="p3"> Plastic is killing many turtles such as six pack rings, bottles, lids, bags etc... "All are impacting the survival of turtles.  scientists examined data about the deaths of 1,000 sea turtles that washed up on the shores of Australia, looking at the amount of plastic debris found inside their stomachs, intestines and rectums. According to a press release, researchers at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia found that a turtle had a 22 percent chance of dying from ingesting one plastic item. Once a turtle gobbles 14 pieces of plastic, the mortality rate jumps to 50 percent". By the world not recycling plastic we are giving animals a way to die. We as a community need to ban togther to prevent more deaths from plastic. </p>
